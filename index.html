        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    

        <p>My name is Thanh Viet Cao (Vietnamese: Cao Thành Việt). I am a seventh-year PhD candidate at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.
          Before that, I got both a B.A. and an M.A. in linguistics from the Faculty of Linguistics, University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University (VNU, Hanoi).
          My main research interests include semantics, pragmatics, and syntax of classifier languages in light of formal approaches, i.e., model-theoretical semantics and comparative syntax within the framework of generative grammar.
          I have just defended my PhD dissertation (title: Quantification and Plurality at the Interface: The case of Vietnamese) under the supervision of Prof. I-Ta Chris Hsieh on May 14th, 2025.
          My thesis mainly touches upon strategies of universal quantification (involving the four D-quantifiers tất-cả, cả, mọi, and mỗi) and plurality (involving các and những) in Vietnamese from compositional and cross-linguistic perspectives. 
          Besides, language contact among MSEA languages from historical linguistics aspects, especially the historical lexicology (i.e., etymology) of the Vietnamese lexicon, always attracts my attention from time to time.</p>

        <blockquote>
        ABSTRACT:<br>
  Alves (2018a) argues that between the atonal (with *-s) and tonal (without *-s) periods in
Chinese, there was an intermediate phase when Chinese qusheng items without *-s were
borrowed into then-atonal Proto-Vietic and resulted in pingsheng reflexes in ESV (i.e.
those bearing ngang/huyền tone). Triplets in Early Sino-Vietnamese (ESV) data like <lãi,
lời, lợi> 利 ‘interest’ or <cũng, cùng, cộng> 共 ‘together’ are among the evidence for this
three-stage hypothesis. If this account is on the right track, however, it is tempting to ask
on what grounds we can sub-stratify non-triplet items like rèn ‘forge’ (OC *[r]ˤen-s) or tên
‘arrow’ (OC *[ts]en-s) into (i) the ESV-I, i.e. the earlier sub-layer, but not (ii) the ESV-II,
i.e. the later sub-layer including lời, cùng, or (iii) just the plain ESV without further timing
specification. In this study, I will elaborate on the idea presented in Cao (to appear) that
the tonal correspondence is insufficient to stratify such items due to a phonotactic
constraint against final sequences of sonorant plus *-s in Proto-Vietic, then discuss the
consequences of this complementary-internal factor for these puzzling cases
