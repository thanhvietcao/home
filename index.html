        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <p><em>View the <a href="https://nthu.academia.edu/vietcao">for my Academia page</a>.</em></p>

        <p>My name is Thanh Viet Cao (Vietnamese: Cao Thành Việt). I am a seventh-year PhD candidate at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.
          Before that, I got both a B.A. and an M.A. in linguistics from the Faculty of Linguistics, University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University (VNU, Hanoi).
          My main research interests include semantics, pragmatics, and syntax of classifier languages in light of formal approaches, i.e., model-theoretical semantics and comparative syntax within the framework of generative grammar.
          I have just defended my PhD dissertation (title: Quantification and Plurality at the Interface: The case of Vietnamese) under the supervision of Prof. I-Ta Chris Hsieh on May 14th, 2025.
          My thesis mainly touches upon strategies of universal quantification (involving the four D-quantifiers tất-cả, cả, mọi, and mỗi) and plurality (involving các and những) in Vietnamese from compositional and cross-linguistic perspectives. 
          Besides, language contact among MSEA languages from historical linguistics aspects, especially the historical lexicology (i.e., etymology) of the Vietnamese lexicon, always attracts my attention from time to time.</p>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>
